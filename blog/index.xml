      <description>Another portion of hot fixes has arrived!
v0.8.2 release brings some critical fixes.
Scrolling position is not centered In 0.8, we introduced a new behavior for all user interactions. Before any actions like clicking ot typing, we scroll into a target element making it visible in a viewport. But the logic behind it, positioned elements on the top of the viewport, which led to some issues on some websites due to their markup - the elements were still invisible because they were under other elements.</description>

      <description>With all big features, come small bugs. :)
With this new v0.8.1 release we are providing hot fixes for some of these small ones.
Broken CLICK function In 0.7 CLICK and CLICK_ALL functions were doing a check before clicking and was returning a boolean value indicating whether a target element was clicked. In 0.8 this logic got broken due to internal refactorings and the check was not performed which led to broken scripts using this returned value.</description>

      <description>As a developer, you&amp;rsquo;ve probably created a couple of web scrapers to get some data from the Internet during your career. That data could be images for an AI project or hotel prices from booking websites for a new travel mobile app or something else. But something that needs data.
It&amp;rsquo;s a relatively easy task to write one or two web scrapers if the amount of required data is small.</description>
