      <description>What is Ferret Query Language? The Ferret Query Language (FQL) is heavily inspired by the ArangoDB Query Language (AQL) and used as a starting point. But due to the domain specifics, there are some differences in how things work and future lagnuage changes are expected.
Even though, FQL is used to read data from the websites, it&amp;rsquo;s considered as a general purpose query language. That means that all web related functionality is implemented as functions from the FQL Standard Library.</description>

      <description>Syntax Query types An FQL query must return a result indicated by usage either of the RETURN or FOR IN keywords. The FQL parser will return an error if it cannot find any of these two statements.
Whitespace Whitespaces (blanks, carriage returns, line feeds, and tab stops) can be used in the query text to increase its readability. Tokens have to be separated by any number of whitespaces. Whitespace within strings or names must be enclosed in quotes in order to be preserved.</description>
